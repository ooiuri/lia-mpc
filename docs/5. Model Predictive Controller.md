This will be the Model Predictive Controller notes:

## 1. Introduction

- [# Predictive Control 1 - Introduction (John Rossiter)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kCcXGDvjU8&list=PLs7mcKy_nInFEpygo_VrqDFCsQVnGaoy-&index=1)

What is predictive control:
- Predictive control describes an approach, not a specific algorythm

We need to understand:
- Why is it done this way?
- What is the impact of uncertainty?
- How does this change with constraints?
- What are the 'tuning' parameters and how can I use them? Which choices are poor and why?

| **The key to effective implementation is a good understanding of how MPC works** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
When speaking about a control technique we might want to look how humans acts in order to peform and control some tasks, like for example:
##### Driving a car:
What is a core component of driving?
1. Drivers look ahead and ==anticipate== future "targets" or demands.
2. Change in the road, pedestrians, other vehicles, change in speed limit, etc

| **Humans use anticipation, that is prediction, to help determine effective control strategies** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> Prediction underpins practical human control strategies and thus seems a logical concept to incorporate into automated strategies

Advantages: 
- Intuitive concept, easy to understand and implement for a variety of systems
- Systematic handling of constraints
- Handles MIMO systems and dead-time without any modification
- Feed forward to make good use of future target information is included implicitly

## Main components

- [# Model Predictive Control 3 - Main components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrlpxOdi34&list=PLs7mcKy_nInFEpygo_VrqDFCsQVnGaoy-&index=3)

The main components of MPC are:

1. Prediction
2. Receding horizon
3. Modelling
4. Performance index
5. Degrees of freedom
6. Constraint handling
7. Multi-variable

##### Prediction
Before planning an activity, always think through all the likely consequences and possibilities, otherwise the outcome may be far from desirable.

- How far should we predict?
	When driving, what prediction horizon is used and why? What happens when it is foggy?
		One always predicts **beyond the safe braking distance**, otherwise one cannot give a reasonable guarantee of avoiding a crash.
		
	**Prediction horizon > settling time**
	 "Common sense analysis of everyday scenarios tell us that we must always predict beyond the key dynamics of a process, otherwise the dynamic part we have not observed (and thus excluded in our decision process) could come back and byte us"
##### Receding horizon
All it means is that we continually update our predictions and decision making to take account of the most recent target and measurement data. 
##### Modelling
In order to automate predictions we need to model a system behaviour in order to computer do predictions 
- Easy to form predictions - ideally linear
- Easy to identify model parameters
- Gives accurate predictions
##### Performance index
Implicitly humans have an internal measure of what constitutes good and bad behaviour
1. What is the performance index used for?
   The performance index is a **numeric definition for best.**
2. How should the performance index be designed?
   Simpler definitions are better as they lead to better conditioned and simpler optimisations.
3. How can we handle trade offs between optimal and safe/robust performance
   High performance demands are not cost free: 
	High performance -> implies high risk
	Low performance  -> likely to be safe

##### Degrees of freedom
How many degrees of freedom?
   The useful number of d.o.f. is linked to prediction accuracy
Ill-posed performance index

##### Constraint handling
The proposed input trajectory is optimal while satisfying constraints
The systematic embedding of constraint information is critical to getting effective and robust closed-loop behaviour

##### Multivariable/interaction
A key observation is that for multivariable processes, often changing one input changes all the outputs and therefore an effective control law has to consider all inputs and outputs simultaneously

##### Summary
1. Modelling efforts shoud be focused on efficacy for prediction, including dependence on d.o.f.
2. Predictions must capture all the transient and steady-state behaviour.
3. Prediction class should include the desired closed-loop behaviour
4. Performance indices must be realistic and maatched to model accuracy.
5. Constraints must be built in from the beginning.
6. Efficient computation requires linear modelss and simpl parameterisations of d.o.f.

## Predictions with state space models

A common discrete state space model is given as:
$$
\begin{align*}
x_{k+1} & = Ax_{k} + Bu_{k} \\
y_{k} & = Cx_{k} + Du_{k} + d_k \\
\end{align*}

$$
where:
- $x$ -> state
- $u$ -> input
- $y$ -> output
- $d$ -> disturbance
- D = 0

Something that is very inte

therefore we should study a little bit about space state representation

###### Prediction notation
In prediction notation we use double subscripts:

$$
x_{k+4|k}
$$
	Prediction of x at sample (k+4) where prediction was made at sample (k)

$$
y_{k+6|k+2}
$$
	Prediction of y at sample (k+6) where prediction was made at sample (k+2)

Summary of prediction control:
$$
\begin{align*}
x_{\rightarrow k+1} & = P_x x_{k} + H_x u_{\rightarrow k} \\
y_{\rightarrow k+1} & = [P x_{k} + Ld_k]+ H_x u_{\rightarrow k} \\
\end{align*}
$$
