#### Ros2Control
We're going to use a package named ros2control to control our robot movement.

[Solving the problem EVERY robot has (with ros2control)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QKsDf1c4hc)

ros2control installation

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros2-control ros-humble-ros2-controllers ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control
```


remember to not use `spawner.py` when using ros-humble and use just `spawner`
```
ros2 run controller_manager spawner diff_cont
```

The configuration files are on the video and on the repo


#### Adding Joystick support
 ```
 sudo apt install joystick jstest-gtk evtest
```

Now Test if your joystick is working with evtest

Then we will see in ros2
```
# enumerate devices
ros2 run joy joy_enumerate_devices

# joy running node
ros2 run joy joy_node

ros2 launch lia_robot joystick.launch.py

```
