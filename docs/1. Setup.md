First, you should install ros:
(here i'm using ros humble - EOL May 2027)

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
``` 

[ROS Humble Installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)

We are going to use colcon to build and create our workspaces, so you can install with this following command:
```
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```


### Creating a workspace and making the first ros package:

In order to get more contact and undertand how ROS works, we are going to follow this excellent tutorial and create our first package (my_package):

[# Making Your First ROS Package | Getting Ready to Build Robots with ROS #5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_SyQXTL2XU)
#### Comands:
 
Colcon Build: 
`colcon build --symlink-install`

Creating ros2 package
`ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake my_package`

---
  Observation: 
	First time a got an error and had to install catkin
	```sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-pkg``` 
	
	also, I had to install it on python
	`pip3 install -U catkin_pkg`

## 2. Installing Gazebo

``` 
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs
``` 

other deps: 
```
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-xacro
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-rcl-action
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-rclpy
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui
```

At this point I had a really hard time dealing with libs so I decided to use conda to create a virtualenv for my python, cause I had python3.11 on my machine and apparently the gazebo things only works on python3.10

install miniconda:
```
 mkdir -p ~/miniconda3 
 wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\n 
 bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3\n 
 rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh 
 ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash 
 ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
 ```

create conda environment:
```
conda create --name pyros python=3.10
# activate conda environment
conda activate pyros
```

after this creation, install required libs:
```
pip install numpy lxml pyyaml rclpy
```
