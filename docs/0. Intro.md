Hello!

I'm Iuri, and I am begining this project with the following goals:

- [ ] Build a car robot simulation system with controls 
- [ ] Visualize and interpret roads and identify the path that should be followed
- [ ] Implement a MPC (Model Predictive Controller) in order to control the robot
- [ ] Build and Communicate with a physical robot with same specs
- [ ] See the robot autonomously following a track with this setup

So, I will list the technologies that will be used.

#### Simulation
- ROS2
- GAZEBO
